Hello there, if you are here you maybe want to help make this project bigger by contributing or thinking of new features.

then you are at the right place in this file you can read how to help.


## New features
You want something in this scripting language added and think it can help the project by thiking about new handy features.

Then you are on the right place, here are the (best) steps to request a new feature.

1. Check at the current issues with the https://github.com/BoMeneerNL/GET-Lang/labels/feature-request tag if it doesn't already exist.<br/>this way we don't have duplicates.
2. if there is no issue already asking for the same feature. Create a new issue stating is detail what the new feature does, this way we know if and how we can implement it.
3. Nice. you've created the issue we will look into as fast as we can. It could be that the feature doesn't impact the scripting language or it is too hard to program for me/us. It could also be that we like to talk more about the feature request. in both cases we will comment on the issue to talk more about it.

## Contributing code (changes)
if you don't want to think about new features, but just type code and contribute here are the steps to do just that.

1. Create a fork of the repository.
2. Make the changes you think can add or change
3. Make sure your new code works
4. Make a pull-request and state the things you changed so we can look into it
5. That's all. It could be the code in the pull-request can not be used by some reason or needs soem changes. If needed we will state it in the comments
